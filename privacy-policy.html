    <h1>Privacy Policy for ThinkPhish</h1>
    <em>Last updated: 20/06/2025</em>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for using ThinkPhish—a Chrome extension designed to help protect you against phishing attempts by analyzing email content in Gmail. This Privacy Policy explains what information ThinkPhish accesses, how it is used solely for security purposes, and the measures we have in place to keep your data safe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>
      <p><strong>Email Content:</strong> ThinkPhish reads the visible email subject and the body text (i.e., the text you see in your Gmail interface). This is used to analyze the email for potential phishing indicators.</p>
      <p><strong>Sender Information:</strong> The extension extracts basic sender details such as the sender’s email address and display name. This helps us perform checks for possible email spoofing.</p>
      <p><strong>URLs Within Emails:</strong> ThinkPhish reviews hyperlinks within the email content, comparing them against known phishing patterns and performing redirect checks to assess their authenticity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p><strong>Phishing Analysis:</strong> The email subject, body text, and sender details are temporarily sent via secure HTTPS to our dedicated phishing detection API. This analysis determines if an email might be a phishing attempt.</p>
      <p><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> We do not permanently save any of your email content or sender details. All data used for analysis is processed in real time and is discarded immediately after providing you with a security assessment.</p>
      <p><strong>Local Processing:</strong> The phishing detection and spoofing checks are performed instantly on the displayed data, ensuring we only use what is necessary to protect you in the moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Data Security and Confidentiality</h2>
      <p><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> All communication between your extension and our phishing detection API is encrypted using HTTPS to ensure that your data remains confidential.</p>
      <p><strong>No External Sharing:</strong> ThinkPhish does not share your email data with third parties. All processing is strictly for the purpose of detecting potential phishing threats in your Gmail account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Minimal Permissions and Transparency</h2>
      <p><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> The extension is designed to operate only on Gmail and to interact exclusively with our secure API. By using ThinkPhish, you agree that the data displayed within your Gmail is used solely for security analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>User Control:</strong> You have full control over your emails. ThinkPhish only processes what is already visible on your screen and does not access any additional personal data such as attachments or login credentials.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
      <p>
        By installing and using ThinkPhish, you consent to the collection and use of your email content as described in this Privacy Policy. This data handling is solely intended to enhance your email security and protect you against phishing attempts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page along with the updated date. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
