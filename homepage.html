    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Manoj Varshan</strong>, a BTech Cyber Security student with a deep passion for innovation, and online safety. I firmly believe that coding isn’t just about prior experience—it’s about creativity, relentless curiosity, and mastering the right tools.</p>

    <p>As an experienced AI tools user and a prompt engineering enthusiast, I created <strong>ThinkPhish</strong> not just as a project—but as a mission. This Chrome extension was developed entirely using AI-assisted development and prompt-driven design, blending technical skill with real-world need.</p>

    <p><strong>ThinkPhish</strong> uses advanced heuristics, redirect path analysis, and a finely tuned SVM (Support Vector Machine) model to intelligently detect and block phishing attempts in your Gmail inbox. It’s designed to act as a real-time guardian—keeping your digital identity and sensitive information secure from deceptive attackers.</p>

    <p>This extension is built with care, precision, and a clear goal: to make cybersecurity accessible and proactive for everyday users. I genuinely hope this helps make your inbox a safer place.</p>

    <p>If you have questions, suggestions, or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me at: <br />
